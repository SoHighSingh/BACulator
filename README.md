## üß¨ **The Science Behind BACulator**

### Advanced Pharmacokinetic Model

BACulator implements a sophisticated multi-phase alcohol metabolism model that far exceeds traditional BAC calculators:

#### **Phase 1: Absorption Modeling**
```
Absorption Rate = 1 - e^(-3 √ó (time_elapsed / 30_minutes))
Peak Absorption: 30 minutes post-consumption
Curve Shape: Exponential approach to maximum
```

Unlike instant-absorption calculators, BACulator models the realistic 30-minute uptake period where alcohol gradually enters your bloodstream through gastric and intestinal absorption.

#### **Phase 2: Distribution Calculation** 
```
BAC = (alcohol_grams) / (body_weight_grams √ó distribution_ratio) √ó 100
Male Distribution Ratio: 0.68 (higher water content)
Female Distribution Ratio: 0.55 (biological differences in body composition)
```

Gender-specific calculations account for physiological differences in total body water content, ensuring accurate BAC estimates for all users.

#### **Phase 3: Elimination Kinetics**
```
Elimination Rate: 0.015% BAC per hour (zero-order kinetics)
Timeline Tracking: Continuous metabolism from first alcohol detection
Adaptive Sampling: Dense calculations during absorption, sparse during elimination
```

BACulator tracks elimination continuously rather than applying simple time-based reductions, ensuring accuracy even with complex drinking patterns.

### **Critical Time Point Algorithm**

The calculator uses intelligent sampling at critical moments:
- **Drink Consumption Times**: When alcohol enters the system
- **Peak Absorption Points**: 30 minutes after each drink
- **Elimination Milestones**: Key BAC threshold crossings
- **User Query Time**: Precise calculation at requested moment

This approach delivers laboratory-grade accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

## üìà **BAC Level Reference**

Understanding what different BAC levels mean for your body:

| BAC Range | Physical Effects | Cognitive Impact | Legal Status |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **0.00-0.03%** | üü¢ No noticeable effects | Normal function | ‚úÖ Legal everywhere |
| **0.03-0.05%** | üü° Mild relaxation, slight euphoria | Slightly reduced inhibition | ‚ö†Ô∏è Some driving restrictions |
| **0.05-0.08%** | üü† Impaired coordination, reduced reaction time | Poor judgment, reduced concentration | üö´ Illegal to drive (most locations) |
| **0.08-0.15%** | üî¥ Significant motor impairment, slurred speech | Severely impaired decision-making | üö® Criminal charges likely |
| **0.15%+** | üíÄ Life-threatening symptoms | Potential loss of consciousness | üö® Medical emergency - call 911 |

> **Critical Reminder**: Individual tolerance varies dramatically. These effects can occur at lower BAC levels depending on body weight, metabolism, medications, food intake, and drinking experience.
